# Note:

- [Due to PWA not allowing GeoLocation in the background](https://github.com/w3c/ServiceWorker/issues/745), the tool cannot meet its expectations despite working fine when the device is unlocked / running in the foreground. This is because of a limitation / refusal to implement background geolocation fetching.
- Due to such, this app won't be developed any further as it has been opted to pursue other methods which will allow background GeoLocation fetching.
